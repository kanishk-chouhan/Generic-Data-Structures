# Generic Data Structure Implementation in C

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive implementation of generic data structures in C. It provides a library for various data structures including Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Stack, Queue, Binary Search Tree, and AVL Tree. The main focus of this project is to create efficient, reusable data structure implementations without a graphical user interface, operating solely within the constraints of RAM.

## Features
- **Singly Linked List**
- **Doubly Linked List**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Binary Search Tree**
- **AVL Tree**
